## Long-Term Goals

- Add Gem for readibility
    > Can be used to guage the performance of a prompt
    * [ ] Add column to track the current prompts readibility
- Integrate with a fact checker
    > Can use the responses from this as a way to train the assistant with fine tuning.
    * [ ] Learn about different fact checkers that I can integrate with
    * [ ] Add column to prompts table to track factuality
- Integrate with some kind of plagarism checker
    > Need to make sure that these are effective.
    > Can use the responses from this as a way to train the assistant with fine tuning.
    * [ ] Add column to prompts table to track plagerism failures
- There needs to be able to mark a certain article as bad, and maybe a  check list for how?
- Integrate with Mozilla TTS
    > I would like the news read to me. Check out Mozilla TTS and see if it's good enough for this
- User Profiles need to be defined
    > Sessions are needed for invites, no need for preferences for mvp
- Switch to an open source LLM
- Images should mainly be sketches
- Integrate with a citation machine for sources
    > There is a gem called citeproc-ruby that might work. This would be good for getting all the articles around a specific event and putting them into sources for the article
- Add Morning Brief
    > This could be done with integrating with weather and traffic apis. Then write a summary on that. I could also include an estimated time to work. If there is a difference outside the norm, then it could notify me. 
- Implment some kind of bias detection
    * [ ] Add column to Prompts table to track bais failures
- Add event search
    > If no similar events are found it should write one.

- Persist database as a volume in the docker-compose file.
    > This is the reason that the database is lost when docker-compose down is run
- Link taskell and the github project
- Get a domain
- Show Articles from yesterday if no articles were generated today
    > Use the application controller to define a single wrapper for content. anything passed into this might be called data:
    * [x] define v2 artciles
    * [x] content should be wrapped in an object so messages can be sent to the client
    * [x] send error http when content is old
    * [x] needs to handle the initial creation of the project. if there are no articles at all

- When updating a prompt it should set sentiment and usage to back to 0
- Use Git integration with SimpleCov to ensure that any change has tests written
    > simplecov-icov has a tool that can check tests for only changed files. this should ensure nearly 100% test coverage and catch anything that isn't tested
- Prompt should be changed to reduce emotional language.
    * [x] The current prompt have content that makes it easy to detect as an ai.
