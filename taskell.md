## Long-Term Goals

- Image resizing needs to be added to support a responsive layout
- Remove Swagger, find yaml to mark down converter
- Switch to an open source LLM
- Add Gem for readibility
    > Can be used to guage the performance of a prompt
    * [ ] Add column to track the current prompts readibility
- Integrate with a fact checker
    > Can use the responses from this as a way to train the assistant with fine tuning.
    * [ ] Learn about different fact checkers that I can integrate with
    * [ ] Add column to prompts table to track factuality
- Integrate with some kind of plagarism checker
    > Need to make sure that these are effective.
    > Can use the responses from this as a way to train the assistant with fine tuning.
    * [ ] Add column to prompts table to track plagerism failures
- User Profiles need to be defined
    > Sessions are needed for invites, no need for preferences for mvp
- Images should mainly be sketches
    * [ ] Find image generation ai to convert images to sketches
- Integrate with a citation machine for sources
    > There is a gem called citeproc-ruby that might work. This would be good for getting all the articles around a specific event and putting them into sources for the article
- Add Morning Brief
    > This could be done with integrating with weather and traffic apis. Then write a summary on that. I could also include an estimated time to work. If there is a difference outside the norm, then it could notify me. 
- Implment some kind of bias detection
    * [ ] Add column to Prompts table to track bais failures
- Add event search
    > If no similar events are found it should write one.

## To Do

- Get sentiment working properly for generated articles
- Request validation in OpenAi integration should happen before parsing the request.
    * [ ] Shold retry on failure
- Fix tests, get pre-commit hook working, even when another person pulls the project
- Get new domains with sub domains working
    * [ ] Buy a domain for the Measured Gazette
    * [ ] Link to static ip
    * [ ] Set nginx up
- Get reporting working (logs, and alerts)
- Github actions should build on merge to main
    > Tests are run locally and in develop before merge to main 
- Add Lazydocker to nvim
- Complete Tests for OpenAi Service
- Complete Tests for Event Registry
- Complete Tests for Generation Service

- Prod should not be using seed data
- Persist database as a volume in the docker-compose file.
    > This is the reason that the database is lost when docker-compose down is run
- Link taskell and the github project
- Get a domain
- Show Articles from yesterday if no articles were generated today
    > Use the application controller to define a single wrapper for content. anything passed into this might be called data:

- Use Git integration with SimpleCov to ensure that any change has tests written
    > simplecov-icov has a tool that can check tests for only changed files. this should ensure nearly 100% test coverage and catch anything that isn't tested
